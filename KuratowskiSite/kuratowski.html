<h2>
Kuratowski's Theorem</h2>

<p><br><i><font size=+1>A necessary and sufficient condition for planarity
of a graph.</font></i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Our presentation is adapted from Section 7.2 of Douglas B. West's 1996
textbook, <i>Introduction to Graph Theory</i>.
<p>A <b>planar graph</b> is one which has a drawing in the plane without
edge crossings.&nbsp; (Of course, we also require that the only vertices
that lie on any given edge are its endpoints.)&nbsp; Any drawing of a planar
graph that satisfies this condition is called a <b>plane drawing</b> of
the graph.
<p>A plane drawing divides the plane into disjoint connected <b>regions</b>,
also called <b>faces</b> of the graph, so that every point in the plane
that is not an element of the graph lies in just one of these regions.&nbsp;
Exactly one region is <b>unbounded</b>, also called the <b>outer face</b>,
and the others are bounded by cycles in the graph.&nbsp; In particular,
every edge in a plane drawing of a planar graph either bounds the outer
face, or bounds exactly two inner faces.&nbsp; It turns out that in this
latter case, we can always redraw the graph so that a given edge bounds
the outer face.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Lemma 1.</b>&nbsp; If <i>G</i> is a planar graph and <i>e</i> is
an edge in <i>G</i>, then there is a plane drawing of <i>G</i> in which
<i>e</i>
bounds the outer face.
<p><b>Proof.</b>&nbsp; Consider any plane drawing of <i>G</i>.&nbsp; Stereographically
project the drawing onto a sphere tangent to the plane that contains this
drawing (see <a href="http://www.ms.uky.edu/~cvl/General_Teaching/stereographic.html">this
page</a> to find out what stereographic projection is).&nbsp; This drawing
on the sphere also has no edge crossings and divides the surface of the
sphere into disjoint connected regions (all of which are bounded!).&nbsp;
Pick a point <i>p</i> in some region of the sphere whose boundary contains
the image of <i>e</i> and consider the plane tangent to the sphere at the
point opposite to <i>p</i>.&nbsp; Now stereographically project the drawing
of <i>G</i> on the sphere onto this new plane.&nbsp; Since <i>p</i> is
the pole of this projection, the region on the sphere containing <i>p</i>
is projected onto the unbounded region in the plane, so this new plane
drawing of <i>G</i> has <i>e</i> on the outer face. //
<br>&nbsp;
<p>To begin the analysis of planarity of graphs, we note first that the
two special graphs
<i>K</i><sub>5</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub> are
nonplanar.&nbsp; Surprisingly, they are fundamental in determining the
planarity of <i>any</i> graph.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Lemma 2.</b>&nbsp; <i>K</i><sub>5</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub>
are nonplanar graphs.
<p><b>Proof.</b>&nbsp; (This is the argument given as Theorem 12.1 in Wilson's
<i>Introduction
to Graph Theory</i>, 4th ed.)&nbsp; For <i>K</i><sub>5</sub>: Label the
vertices <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>.&nbsp; The graph
contains the cycle <i>vwxyzv</i> and any plane drawing of <i>K</i><sub>5</sub>
must display the cycle in the form of a pentagon.&nbsp; The edge <i>zw</i>
either lies inside or outside the pentagon.&nbsp; If <i>zw</i> lies inside
the pentagon, then the edges <i>vx</i> and <i>vy</i> must lie outside the
pentagon else they would cross <i>zw</i>.&nbsp; Consequently, <i>xz</i>
must lie inside the pentagon else it would cross <i>vy</i>.&nbsp; But now
there is no way to draw edge <i>wy</i> without forcing a crossing.&nbsp;
If <i>zw</i> lies outside the pentagon, then the edges <i>vx</i> and <i>vy</i>
must lie inside, and so <i>xz</i> must lie outside, forcing the edge <i>wy</i>
into a crossing.&nbsp; Thus, <i>K</i><sub>5 </sub>is nonplanar.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p><img SRC="k33nonplanar.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=179 width=431></center>

<p>For <i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub>: label the vertices of one side of the bipartition
<i>u</i>,
<i>w</i>,
<i>y</i>,
and those of the other side <i>v</i>,
<i>x</i>,
<i>z</i>.&nbsp; Then the
graph contains the cycle <i>uvwxyzu</i>.&nbsp; So any plane drawing of
<i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub>
must display the cycle in the form of a hexagon.&nbsp; The edge <i>zw</i>
either lies inside or outside the hexagon.&nbsp; If
<i>zw</i> lies inside
the hexagon, then the edge
<i>ux</i> must lie outside to avoid a crossing
with <i>zw</i>.&nbsp; But then there is no way to draw
<i>vy</i> without
forcing a crossing.&nbsp; If <i>zw</i> lies outside the hexagon, then the
edge <i>ux</i> must lie inside to avoid a crossing with
<i>zw</i> and there
is again no way to draw <i>vy</i> without forcing a crossing.&nbsp; Thus,
<i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub>
is nonplanar. //
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It is now clear that if <i>G</i> is a planar graph, it cannot <i>contain</i>
a subgraph isomorphic to either <i>K</i><sub>5</sub> or <i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub>,
else a plane drawing of <i>G</i> would contain inside it a plane drawing
of either <i>K</i><sub>5</sub> or <i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub>.&nbsp; But there
are many graphs that do not contain either of these graphs and still are
nonplanar.&nbsp; Consider for instance the graph pictured below.
<center>
<p><img SRC="contractible.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=137 width=142></center>

<p>These can be handled by means of a particularly useful process: if <i>H</i>
is a graph and <i>e</i> is an edge in <i>H</i>, the <b>contraction</b>
of <i>H</i> by <i>e</i> is the graph we denote <i>H</i> \ <i>e</i>, obtained
by removing <i>e</i> from <i>H</i> and fusing its endpoints together (maintaining
all the edges incident with these vertices).&nbsp; (See pp. 13-14 of Wilson.)&nbsp;
As a result, <nobr><i>H</i> \ <i>e</i></nobr> has order one less and size
one less than <i>H</i>.&nbsp; Note that if <i>e</i> lies in a triangle
in H, then the other two edges of the triangle become repeated edges in
<i>H</i>
\ <i>e</i>.&nbsp; That is, <i>H</i> \ <i>e</i> is not a simple graph.&nbsp;
However, if <i>e</i> does not lie in a triangle, <i>H</i> \ <i>e</i> is
simple.&nbsp; Most importantly, however, is the following simple result:
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Lemma 3.&nbsp; </b>If<i> H</i> is a planar graph, then so is any
graph (simple or not) obtained from <i>H</i> by contracting an edge. //
<br>&nbsp;
<p>So any graph that is <b>contractible</b> to either <i>K</i><sub>5</sub>
or <i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub>--that is, can be reduced to one of these two
graphs by a sequence of edge contractions--is also nonplanar.&nbsp; (The
graph pictured here above is easily seen to be contractible to <i>K</i><sub>5</sub>.)&nbsp;
We call such a graph a <b>Kuratowski</b> graph.
<p>We may now state
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER=3 CELLSPACING=3 CELLPADDING=3 >
<tr>
<td><b>Kuratowski's Theorem.</b>&nbsp; The graph <i>G</i> is planar if
and only if it does not contain a Kuratowski subgraph.</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>Of course, we have just proved that possession of a Kuratowski subgraph
is a <i>necessary</i> condition that a graph be planar.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
this is the easy half of the proof of the theorem!&nbsp; The proof of sufficiency
is much more involved.
<p>We will proceed by contradiction: suppose there is some graph that contains
no Kuratowski subgraph, yet is nonplanar.&nbsp; Then, of all such graphs,
there must be one of minimal size; call it <i>G</i>.&nbsp; We continue
by considering the connectivity
<font face="Symbol">k</font>(<i>G</i>)
of the graph (the smallest number of vertices whose removal from <i>G</i>
disconnects <i>G</i>).
<p>If <font face="Symbol">k</font>(<i>G</i>) = 0, then <i>G</i> is disconnected,
and since <i>G</i> is nonplanar, at least one of its components must be
nonplanar.&nbsp; But then any of its nonplanar components contains no subgraph
isomorphic to either <i>K</i><sub>5</sub> or <i>K</i><sub>3,3 </sub>and
is of smaller size than <i>G</i>, violating the minimality condition.&nbsp;
Thus, <font face="Symbol">k</font>(<i>G</i>) > 0 and <i>G</i> must be connected.
<p>If <font face="Symbol">k</font>(<i>G</i>) = 1, then <i>G</i> has a cut-vertex
<i>v</i>;
that is, <i>G</i> <font face="Symbol">-</font> <i>v</i> breaks up into
<i>k</i>
components.&nbsp; Let <i>G</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>G</i><sub>2</sub>, ... ,
<i>G<sub>k</sub></i>
be the corresponding subgraphs of <i>G</i> formed from these components
by adding <i>v</i> and all the edges of <i>G</i> incident with <i>v</i>
whose other endpoint lies within that component.&nbsp; Since each <i>G<sub>i</sub></i>
is of smaller size than <i>G</i>, they are planar graphs.&nbsp; So there
are plane drawings of each <i>G<sub>i</sub></i>, and by applying Lemma
1 to each <i>G<sub>i</sub></i> with respect to some edge in <i>G<sub>i</sub></i>
incident with <i>v</i>, we can arrange that these plane drawings all have
<i>v</i>
on the outer face.&nbsp; In fact, we can easily force each plane drawing
to lie entirely within an angle of measure 360/<i>k</i> degrees with <i>v</i>
at the vertex of the angle.&nbsp; These plane drawings can now be arranged
around <i>v</i> in consecutive sectors of measure 360/<i>k</i> degrees
each to obtain a plane drawing of <i>G</i>, contradiction.&nbsp; Thus,
<font face="Symbol">k</font>(<i>G</i>)
> 1.
<p>If <font face="Symbol">k</font>(<i>G</i>) = 2, then it contains a vertex
cutset consisting of 2 vertices: <i>S</i> = {<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>}.&nbsp;
Thus, <i>G</i> <font face="Symbol">-</font> <i>S</i> breaks up into components.&nbsp;
Let <i>G</i><sub>1</sub> be the graph formed from one of these components
by adding to it the vertices <i>u</i>and&nbsp; <i>v</i>, all the edges
of <i>G</i> incident with either <i>u</i> or <i>v</i> whose other endpoint
lies within that component, and the edge <i>uv</i> (even if <i>uv</i> is
not an edge in <i>G</i>).&nbsp; Let <i>G</i><sub>2</sub> be the graph formed
from the other components of <i>G</i> <font face="Symbol">-</font> <i>S</i>
by adding the vertices <i>u</i>and&nbsp; <i>v</i>, all the edges of <i>G</i>
incident with either <i>u</i> or <i>v</i> whose other endpoint lies within
any of the these components, and the edge <i>uv</i>.&nbsp; Since <i>G</i><sub>1
</sub>and
<i>G</i><sub>2</sub>
are of smaller size than <i>G</i>, they are planar graphs.&nbsp; So there
are plane drawings of each, and by applying Lemma 1, we can arrange that
both of these plane drawings have <i>uv</i> on the outer face.&nbsp; We
can now "glue" the two drawings together along the edge <i>uv</i> to obtain
a plane drawing of <i>G</i> (by deleting <i>uv</i> if it does not belong
to <i>G</i>), a contradiction.&nbsp; Thus, <font face="Symbol">k</font>(<i>G</i>)
> 2.&nbsp; That is, <i>G</i> is 3-connected.
<p>Since <i>G</i> is 3-connected, it must contain more than 3 vertices.&nbsp;
But the only 3-connected graph of order 4 is <i>K</i><sub>4</sub>, which
is planar.&nbsp; So <i>G</i> must have order at least 5.&nbsp; Also, since
<i>G</i>
is 3-connected, the minimum degree in <i>G</i> is at least 3 (the neighbors
of any vertex of degree less than 2 would form a separating set with fewer
than 3 vertices).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Lemma 4.</b>&nbsp; A 3-connected graph must contain an edge whose
contraction produces a 3-connected graph.
<p><b>Proof.</b>&nbsp; Suppose not.&nbsp; Then there is some 3-connected
graph <i>H</i> so that no contraction of it is also 3-connected.&nbsp;
Let <i>e</i> be some edge in <i>H</i>.&nbsp; To say that <i>H</i> \ <i>e</i>
is not 3-connected means that it contains a separating set with fewer than
3 vertices.&nbsp; This separating set must contain the vertex <i>a</i>
obtained by fusing the endpoints <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> of <i>e</i>; otherwise
it would contain no vertex incident with <i>e</i> in <i>H</i> and this
same set of vertices would be a separating set in <i>H</i>, contradicting
that <i>H</i> is 3-connected.&nbsp; In fact, any separating set in <i>H</i>
\ <i>e</i> must contain <i>a</i> and some other vertex <i>z</i>, else {<i>x</i>,
<i>y</i>}
would be a separating set in <i>H</i>, contradicting again that
<i>H</i>
is 3-connected.&nbsp; Therefore, {<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>} is a separating
set in <i>H</i>.&nbsp; Since <i>z</i> need not be the only vertex in <i>H</i>
\ <i>e</i> which forms a separating set with <i>a</i>, let us settle on
a choice of <i>e</i> and <i>z</i> so that the resulting separating set
{<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
<i>z</i>} in <i>H</i> is one whose removal from
<i>H</i>
leaves a component
<i>K</i> of maximal order, and let <i>L</i> denote some
component different from
<i>K</i> in this graph.
<p>If <i>z</i> had no neighbor in <i>L</i>, then <i>L</i> could be separated
from the rest of <i>H</i> simply by removing <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, violating
once again the 3-connectedness of <i>H</i>.&nbsp; So <i>z</i> must have
a neighbor in <i>L </i>which we will call <i>u</i>; similarly, it has a
neighbor in <i>K</i>.&nbsp; The same argument shows that both <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i> must have neighbors in <i>K</i> and neighbors in <i>L</i>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<center>
<p><i>H</i>
<br><img SRC="thomassen.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=147 width=291 align=ABSCENTER></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Applying the same argument to the edge <i>zu</i> that we used on
<i>e</i>
above, we must be able to find another vertex <i>v</i> in <i>H</i> so that
<nobr>{<i>z</i>,
<i>u</i>,
<i>v</i>}</nobr>
forms a separating set in <i>H</i>.
<p>If <i>K</i>&acute; is the connected subgraph of <i>H</i> obtained by
adding to <i>K</i> the vertices
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> together with any
edges connecting these two vertices to each other or any vertex in <i>K</i>,
then consider the question of whether <i>v</i> lies in <i>K</i>&acute;.&nbsp;
If so, then we claim that <i>K</i>&acute; <font face="Symbol">-</font><i>v</i>
must also be connected, otherwise <nobr><i>H</i> <font face="Symbol">-</font>
{<i>z</i>, <i>v</i>}</nobr> would be disconnected, in violation of the
3-connectedness of <i>H</i>.&nbsp; Therefore, <i>K</i>&acute; <font face="Symbol">-</font><i>v</i>
lies in a component of <nobr><i>H</i> <font face="Symbol">-</font> {<i>z</i>,
<i>u</i>,
<i>v</i>}</nobr>
which has larger order than <i>K</i>.&nbsp; But this violates the condition
that defined our choice of <i>K</i>.&nbsp; So v cannot lie in <nobr><i>K</i>&acute;</nobr>.&nbsp;
But then it follows that <nobr><i>K</i>&acute;</nobr> lies in a component
of <nobr><i>H</i><font face="Symbol">-</font> {<i>z</i>,
<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>}</nobr>
which has larger order than <i>K</i> and the same contradiction occurs.&nbsp;
The lemma has now been proved.&nbsp; //
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By this lemma, <i>G</i> must have an edge <i>e = vw</i> whose contraction
<nobr><i>G</i>&acute;</nobr>
= <nobr><i>G</i> \ <i>e</i></nobr> is also 3-connected.&nbsp; Let <i>u</i>
be the vertex in <nobr><i>G</i>&acute;</nobr> formed by the contraction
of <i>e</i> in <i>G</i>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Lemma 5.</b>&nbsp; <nobr><i>G</i>&acute;</nobr> contains no Kuratowski
subgraph.
<p><b>Proof.</b>&nbsp; By contradiction.&nbsp; Let <i>K</i> be a Kuratowski
subgraph of <nobr><i>G</i>&acute;</nobr>.&nbsp; If <i>u</i> were not a
vertex of
<i>K</i>, then <i>K</i> would be a subgraph of
<i>G</i>.&nbsp;
But <i>G</i>contains no Kuratowski subgraph, so <i>u</i> must lie in
<i>K</i>.&nbsp;
Let <i>H</i> be the subgraph of <i>G</i> whose edges are those of <i>K</i>
together with the edge <i>e</i> (and whose vertices are precisely the endpoints
of these edges in <i>G</i>); that is,
<nobr><i>H</i> \ <i>e</i> = <i>K</i></nobr>.&nbsp;
Since <i>H</i> is contractible to <i>K</i> and <i>K</i> is a Kuratowski
graph, so is <i>H</i>, whence
<i>G</i> contains a Kuratowski subgraph,
contradiction.&nbsp; //
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Since <i>G</i> contains no Kuratowski subgraph, is nonplanar and is
of minimal size with these properties, it follows that <nobr><i>G</i>&acute;</nobr>,
a graph of size smaller than that of <i>G</i> which also contains no Kuratowski
subgraph, must be planar.&nbsp; Consider a plane drawing of <nobr><i>G</i>&acute;</nobr>.&nbsp;
Deleting the edges of <nobr><i>G</i>&acute;</nobr> which are incident with
<i>u</i>
leaves a planar graph one of whose faces contains the vertex <i>u</i>;
let <i>C</i> be the cycle bounding this face.&nbsp; The vertices of <i>C</i>
are precisely the neighbors of <i>v</i> and <i>w</i> in <i>G</i>.&nbsp;
Denote the neighbors of <i>v</i> by <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <nobr><i>x</i><sub>2</sub>,
... , <i>x<sub>r</sub></i>, labeling them clockwise around <i>C</i>.</nobr>&nbsp;
Since the minimum degree in <i>G</i> is at least 3, <i>v</i> has at least
two neighbors besides <i>w</i>, so we have <nobr><i>r</i> <u>></u> 2.</nobr>
<p>Suppose all of the neighbors of <i>w</i> lie strictly between some one
pair of consecutive <i>x</i>'s along <i>C</i>; without loss of generality,
we may assume that they lie between <i>x<sub>r</sub></i> and <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;
Working clockwise around <i>C</i>, we label them <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>,
<nobr><i>y</i><sub>2</sub>,
... , <i>y<sub>s</sub></i></nobr>.&nbsp; We also have <i>s</i> <u>></u>
2.&nbsp; Then from the plane drawing of <nobr><i>G</i>&acute;
</nobr>we
can obtain a plane drawing of <i>G</i> by (1) deleting <i>u</i>, and putting
in its place the vertex <i>v</i> together with the edges joining it to
the <i>x</i>'s, (2) placing a new vertex labeled <i>w</i> in the resulting
face which has <i>v</i> and all the <i>y</i>'s on its boundary, (3) adding
the edges from <i>w</i> to each of the <i>y</i>'s.&nbsp; So
<i>G</i> is
planar, contradiction.&nbsp; The same argument can be used if as many as
two of the neighbors of <i>w</i> are among the <i>x</i>'s; in this case,
we label them <i>y</i><sub>1</sub> = <i><nobr>x<sub>r</sub></nobr></i>
and <i><nobr>y<sub>s</sub></nobr></i> = <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="Gdrawing.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=161 width=342></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>If as many as three of the neighbors of <i>w</i> are among the <i>x</i>'s,
say <i><nobr>x<sub>i</sub></nobr></i>, <i><nobr>x<sub>j</sub></nobr></i>,
and <i><nobr>x<sub>k</sub></nobr></i> (<i>i</i> &lt; <i>j</i> &lt; <i>k</i>),
then let <i>K</i> be the subgraph of <i><nobr>G</nobr></i> consisting of
<i>C</i>,the
vertices <i>v</i> and <i>w</i> and the edge <i>vw</i>, and the six edges
<i><nobr>vx<sub>i</sub></nobr></i>,
<i><nobr>vx<sub>j</sub></nobr></i>,
<i><nobr>vx<sub>k</sub></nobr></i>,
<i><nobr>wx<sub>i</sub></nobr></i>,
<i><nobr>wx<sub>j</sub></nobr></i>,
and <i><nobr>wx<sub>k</sub></nobr></i>.&nbsp; Then <i>K</i> is a Kuratowski
subgraph, contractible to <i>K</i><sub>5</sub>, contradiction.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="subgraphk5.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=196 width=163></center>

<p><br>
<p>Thus, no more than two of the neighbors of <i>w</i> are among the
<i>x</i>'s
and not all the neighbors of <i>w</i> lie between some pair of consecutive
<i>x</i>'s along <i>C</i>.&nbsp; Consequently, there are two neighbors
of <i>w</i>, say <i>y</i> and <i>y&acute;</i>, and two neighbors, <i>x</i>
and <i>x&acute;</i>, of <i>v</i>, which are <i>not</i> neighbors of <i>w</i>
also, so that <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>x&acute;</i>, <i>y&acute;</i>occur
in this order moving clockwise around <i>C</i>.&nbsp; Let <i>K</i> be the
subgraph of <i><nobr>G</nobr></i> consisting of <i>C</i>together with the
vertices <i>v</i> and <i>w</i>, and the four edges <i>vx</i>,
<i>vx&acute;</i>,
<i>wy</i>,
and <i>wy&acute;</i>.&nbsp; By successively contracting all the edges of
<i>K</i> which do not have one of these six vertices (<i>v</i>, <i>w</i>,
<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>x&acute;</i>, <i>y&acute;</i>) as an endpoint, we
find that <i>K</i> is contractible to <i>K</i><sub>3,3</sub>, a contradiction.
<br>&nbsp;
<center>
<p>
<img SRC="subgraphk33.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=163 width=325></p></center>

<p><br>This exhausts all possibilities, so no such graph <i>G</i> can exist.&nbsp;
The proof is now complete.
